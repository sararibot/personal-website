## In a fishermen's hut

Photographic documentary that reflects the relationship between humans and nature. It is inspired by NÃºria, a young woman who lives in a small fishermen's hut in the middle of nowhere. This photographic series intends to show the most primitive part of the human being.

The main purpose was to expose the relationship between humans and nature, as well as to capture the energy that the earth transmits to a person who nourishes from it. Showing the meaningful and precious details of their day-to-day life.

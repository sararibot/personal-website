## The Scenario
The scenario we were going to explore was Cafés Roure, a charming little coffee shop located in the heart of Barcelona. They pride themselves on offering a delightful selection of specialty coffees. The ambiance is simply picturesque, attracting a diverse mix of cultures and nationalities, all coming together to enjoy the experience. Their carefully curated coffee beans are sourced from various regions worldwide, spanning from Africa to South America. 

What truly sets Roure apart is their genuine connection with customers and the unique atmosphere they cultivate, making it a truly special place to enjoy a cup of coffee.

## Design approach

Our primary focus was to treat the problem with as much significance as finding the solution. To achieve this, we employed the Double Diamond methodology, which enabled us to deeply understand the problem and devise an effective solution.

Throughout the entire project, we adhered to a user-centered design approach. This entailed extensive exploration and attentive listening to the needs of the users during the initial phase. This approach proved to be indispensable as it guided us in determining the precise direction we aimed to pursue.

## Reaserch
Our research process was exhaustive, as we sought to gain a thorough understanding of the company. We employed a variety of techniques, including:

- Trend review
- Benchmarking
- Contextual observation
- Mystery shopper
- Surveys
- Interviews

This comprehensive approach allowed us to fully immerse ourselves in the world of our users, understand their stories, key needs and objectives. On this basis, we were able to identify a compelling value proposition.
